Introducing the No Agenda Latest FRsync (FEMA Region-Delineated Redundant Sync Solution)

I'll take whatever I can get out of Adam's own NA-Latest btsync folder and/or his output @ BitLove and/or simply his shownotes each day after the live transmission. At the latest, I'll be up to 24 hours behind Adam's own publishing times. This means that by Friday 2-4pm I'll have Thursday's podcast up and ready to sync in these folders. I'll store the latest five (5) episodes. Feel free to sign up for all of them if you enjoy file-serving, being a contributor, etc. Feel free to sign up for only one. If you'd like to sign up for FEMA Region 1 sync because you live in FEMA Region 1 or because you wanna throw a wrench in the works and you actually reside in FEMA Region 3, I couldn't care less. If the problems with our current usage of BTSync as a media distribution tool have to do with having too many machines connected to each shared folder, perhaps we can get around that by having many redundant shared folders.
